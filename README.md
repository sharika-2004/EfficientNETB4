# EfficientNETB4


Flower Classification with EfficientNetB4
This project uses EfficientNetB4, a powerful CNN architecture, to classify flower images into 5 categories:
ðŸŒ¹ Rose | ðŸŒ¼ Daisy | ðŸŒ» Sunflower | ðŸŒ¸ Tulip | ðŸŒ¿ Dandelion

How It Works
Upload an Image

The system accepts .jpg, .jpeg, or .png files.

You can upload any flower photo via an interactive dialog.

AI Prediction

The trained EfficientNetB4 model processes the image.

It outputs:
âœ… Predicted flower class (e.g., "Sunflower")
ðŸ“Š Confidence score (e.g., "98.5%")
ðŸ“ˆ Probabilities for all classes (visualized in a bar chart)

Result Display

Shows the uploaded image alongside predictions.

Handles errors (wrong file type, no upload, etc.) gracefully.

Use Cases
ðŸŒ¸ Plant identification for gardening apps

ðŸ“¸ Educational tools for botany students

ðŸ“± Mobile apps for flower enthusiasts

Simply upload a flower image, and the AI identifies it instantly! ðŸš€
